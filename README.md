# MegapixImageFile for iOS

Fixes iOS6 image file rendering issue for large size image (over megapixel), which causes unexpected subsampling when drawing it in canvas, and safely renders with proper stretching.

Although it mainly focuses fixing iOS related issues, it can be safely used in the envionments other than iOS6.
